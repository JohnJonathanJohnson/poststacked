# URGENT

1. Static Typing.
2. Good Error Detection.
3. Backends
4. Libraries and File-linking.
5. Fix the tree-creation function. Currently cannot create {Expression} {Expression} from {Expr{Expression}ession}, assuming the inner has no side-effect.

## Less Urgent

1. Diving to a lower level of choice (depends on backend).
2. A good documentation.

### Completely Optional

1. Vim/emacs modes.
